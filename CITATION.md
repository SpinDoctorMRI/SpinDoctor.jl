## Matrix formalism

This article describes the matrix formalism approach combined with the finite element
method:

@article{MatrixFormalism,
  author  = {Li, Jing-Rebecca and Tran, Try and Nguyen, Van-Dang},
  doi     = {10.1002/nbm.4353},
  journal = {NMR in Biomedicine},
  month   = {07},
  pages   = {},
  title   = {Practical computation of the diffusion {MRI} signal of realistic neurons based on {Laplace} eigenfunctions},
  volume  = {33},
  year    = {2020}
}
```

This article describes the extension of the matrix formalism to permeable membranes:
