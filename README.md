This is a Julia implementation of the SpinDoctor toolbox. The original MATLAB toolbox can be
found at https://github.com/jingrebeccali/SpinDoctor.

SpinDoctor is a software package that performs numerical simulations of diffusion magnetic
resonance imaging (dMRI) for prototyping purposes.

SpinDoctor can be used

1. to solve the Bloch-Torrey partial differential equation (BTDPE) to obtain the dMRI signal
   (the toolbox provides a way of robustly fitting the dMRI signal to obtain the fitted
   Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC));
2. to solve the diffusion equation for the homogenized ADC (HADC) model to obtain the ADC;
3. a short-time approximation formula for the ADC is also included in the toolbox for
   comparison with the simulated ADC;
4. Compute the dMRI signal using a matrix formalism (MF) analytical solution based Laplace
   eigenfunctions.

The PDEs and Laplace eigenvalue decompositions are solved by P1 finite elements. The
geometry recipes create surface triangulations that are passed to
[TetGen](https://wias-berlin.de/software/index.jsp?id=TetGen&lang=1) to perform the finite
element mesh generation.

SpinDoctor has support for the following features:

1. multiple compartments connected through permeable membranes, with different
   * initial spin densities,
   * diffusion tensors,
   * T2-relaxation, and
   * permeability coefficients for the BTPDE and MF (the HADC assumes negligible
     permeability);
2. diffusion-encoding gradient pulse sequences, including
   * the pulsed gradient spin echo sequence (PGSE),
   * the double-PGSE,
   * the oscillating gradient spin echo (OGSE), and
   * custom three-dimensional pulse sequences `gâƒ—(t) = (g_x(t), g_y(t),
     g_z(t))`;
3. uniformly distributed gradient directions in 2D and 3D for high angular resolution
   diffusion imaging (HARDI).

SpinDoctor also comes with a geometry generation module, allowing for

1. spherical cells with a nucleus;
2. cylindrical cells with a myelin layer;
3. an extra-cellular space (ECS) enclosed in either a box, a convex hull, or a tight
   wrapping around the cells;
4. deformation of canonical cells by bending and twisting.

In addition, a variety of neuron meshes is available, whose surface geometries were
extracted from [NeuroMopho.org](http://neuromorpho.org). The neurons may also be enclosed in
an extracellular space as described above.


### Spinning spindle spins in SpinDoctor

![Spindle](misc/spindle.gif)

The above graphic visualizes the real part of the magnetization as a z-displacement for the
spindle neuron geometry `03b_spindle4aACC` (extracted from
[NeuroMorpho](http://neuromorpho.org/)). The gradient is a PGSE sequence in the x-direction.
The magnetization was saved for 200 time steps, and the exported VTK sequence was visualized
using [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org).

Here the magnetization is shown in a dendrite branch during a three-dimensional gradient
sequence.

## Getting started

1. The `examples` folder contains three drivers showing how to create geometry and solve
   different problems.
2. The input files for the drivers are found in the folder `examples/setups`, and define
   different models.
3. Multiple neuron meshes are available from
   [NeuronMeshes](https://github.com/SpinDoctorMRI/NeuronMeshes). These can be loaded in
   the file `examples/setups/neuron.jl`.
4. See the [documentation page](https://spindoctormri.github.io/SpinDoctor.jl/dev) for more details.
